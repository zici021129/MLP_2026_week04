    "## Creating a Train-Test Set <a id='gen'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before modelling, we will first split the data into the train and test sets. This ensures that that we do not violate one of the golden rules of machine learning: never use the test set for training. As EDA can help guide the choice and form of model, we ideally want to split the data before EDA, to avoid peeking at the test data too much during this phase. However, in practice, we may need to investigate the entire data during EDA to get a better idea on how to handle issues such as missingness, categorical data (and rare categories), incorrect data, etc.      \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways of creating a test set. We will use a helpful function from `sklearn.model_selection` called `train_test_split`. You can have a look at the documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html. Note that `train_test_split` defaults to randomly sampling the data to split it into training and validation/test sets, that is, the default value is `shuffle=True`  \n",
    "\n",
    "For reproducibility, we first fix the value in the numpy random seed about the state of randomness. This ensures that, every step including randomness, will produce the same output if we re-run the code or if someone else wants to reproduce our results (e.g. produce the same train-test split).\n",
    "\n",
    "In `sklearn`, the suggestion to control randomness across multiple consecutive executions is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to obtain reproducible (i.e. constant) results across multiple program executions, we need to remove all uses of `random_state=None`, which is the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Declare your own `rng` variable (random number generator) at the top of the program, and pass it down to any object that accepts a `random_state` parameter. You can check some details from here; https://numpy.org/doc/1.16/reference/generated/numpy.random.RandomState.html\n",

So for our pipeline the parameter is named `columntransformer__pipeline__polynomialfeatures__degree`. If you want to list the names of all available parameters you can call the `get_params()` method on the model object, e.g. `polyreg_pipe.get_params()` here."
